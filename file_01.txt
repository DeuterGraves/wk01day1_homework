*** This is how the homework was done ***
notes for when I forget all this:


Local

Create a folder
 - In terminal mkdir <dir name>
Initialize a git repository in the folder
 - git init
Create a couple of text files .txt
 - touch <filename>.txt <filename>.txt
Stage the files
 - git add . (or exact file name)
Commit the files to the repository
 - git commit -m "commit message" (there's a cool failsafe with atom and possibly others - fill in the message save and close to resume work in terminal)
Change the files
 - atom . or exact file name - to launch atom and edit
Commit the changes
 - git add (ad)
 - git commit (as above)

Remote - Github

Create new repository
 - log into Github > + new repository


Local

Add the Github remote
 - there's commands you can copy and paste from github to add a new orgin - it will look like:
 git remote add origin https://github.com/DeuterGraves/git_demo.git
git push -u origin master
** ask - what if I want to make another computer an origin - how do I find or replicate that code?
Push to the remote repository
 - push enter at that point.
 - git commit

 change
